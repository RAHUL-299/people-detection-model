Object Detection Using U-Net from Scratch
This repository provides an end-to-end solution for object detection using the U-Net architecture, trained from scratch. The model is designed to segment different regions in images (like background and objects) and can be applied to various image segmentation tasks.

Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow (for deep learning and training the U-Net model)
OpenCV (for image manipulation)
Matplotlib (for plotting and visualizing the results)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
requests (for downloading data from URLs)
pycocotools (for handling COCO dataset annotations)
Pillow (for image processing)
shapely (for geometric operations)
os (for handling file paths and directories)
You can install all required libraries using the following command:

Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Files Overview
download.py: Downloads the raw data from the source (e.g., COCO dataset).
preprocessing.py: Preprocesses the raw data for model training, such as resizing images, normalizing, and converting them to the correct format.
model.py: Contains the code for defining and training the U-Net model.
main.py: Tests the model on a custom image and visualizes the predicted segmentation.
U-Net Overview
U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for image segmentation tasks. It has an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder captures high-level features and the decoder restores the spatial dimensions. Key to its success are skip connections that transfer high-resolution features from the encoder to the decoder, improving accuracy. U-Net is efficient for tasks like segmenting objects or regions in images, and is widely used in medical imaging and other segmentation applications.

Training the Model
To train the model, run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
python model.py
Ensure that you have the raw data properly preprocessed and available before running this step.

Notes:
The model uses the U-Net architecture, which performs well for segmentation tasks by learning to classify each pixel of an image.
The training process uses TPU acceleration in Google Colab for faster processing.
Testing the Model
Once the model is trained, you can test it with new images using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
How to Use main.py:
Set the correct path to your trained model (model.h5).
Set the path to the image you want to test.
The code will load the model, preprocess the input image, and display the segmentation result.
Example:
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import cv2
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model_path = 'path/for/model/model.h5'
model = load_model(model_path)

img_path = 'path/for/img'

img = cv2.imread(img_path)
img = cv2.resize(img, (256, 256))

img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

img = img.astype('float32') / 255.0  # Assuming the model expects values in the range [0, 1]

# Add batch dimension to the image (from (256, 256, 3) to (1, 256, 256, 3))
img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

# Predict using the model
predictions = model.predict(img)
plt.imshow(predictions[0])  # Assuming the model outputs an image of the same shape
plt.show()
Data
The dataset used for training comes from the COCO 2017 dataset, which contains a variety of labeled images. The data is preprocessed to focus on identifying specific regions like background and objects in images. The segmentation mask generated by the model is visualized by overlaying it on the original image.
