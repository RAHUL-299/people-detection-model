# Object Detection Using U-Net from Scratch  

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for object detection using the U-Net architecture, trained from scratch. The model is designed to segment different regions in images (like background and objects) and can be applied to various image segmentation tasks.  

---

## Requirements  

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:  

- TensorFlow: For deep learning and training the U-Net model.  
- OpenCV: For image manipulation.  
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the results.  
- NumPy: For numerical operations.  
- requests: For downloading data from URLs.  
- pycocotools: For handling COCO dataset annotations.  
- Pillow: For image processing.  
- shapely: For geometric operations.  
- os: For handling file paths and directories.  

You can install all required libraries using:  

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Files Overview  

- `download.py`: Downloads the raw data from the source (e.g., COCO dataset).  
- `preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses the raw data for model training, such as resizing images, normalizing, and converting them to the correct format.  
- `model.py`: Contains the code for defining and training the U-Net model.  
- `main.py`: Tests the model on a custom image and visualizes the predicted segmentation.

## U-Net Overview  

U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for image segmentation tasks. It has an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder captures high-level features and the decoder restores spatial dimensions. Skip connections transfer high-resolution features from the encoder to the decoder, improving segmentation accuracy.  

Applications of U-Net include:  
- Medical image segmentation.  
- Object and region segmentation in general datasets.

## Training the Model  

To train the model, run:  

`python model.py`  

Notes:  
- Ensure the raw data is preprocessed and available before running the training script.  
- Training leverages TPU acceleration in Google Colab for faster computation.

## Testing the Model  

Once the model is trained, test it with new images using:  

`python main.py`  

To use `main.py`, update the script with:  
1. The correct path to your trained model (`model.h5`).  
2. The path to the image you want to test.

## Data  

The dataset used for training is the COCO 2017 dataset, which contains a variety of labeled images. The data is preprocessed to focus on identifying specific regions like background and objects in images. The segmentation mask generated by the model is visualized by overlaying it on the original image.
