# Object Detection Using U-Net from Scratch

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for object detection using the U-Net architecture, trained from scratch. The model is designed to segment different regions in images (such as background and objects) and can be applied to a variety of image segmentation tasks.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning and training the U-Net model.
- **OpenCV**: For image manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing the results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **requests**: For downloading data from URLs.
- **pycocotools**: For handling COCO dataset annotations.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **shapely**: For geometric operations.
- **os**: For handling file paths and directories.

Install all the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Files Overview
download.py: Downloads the raw data from the source (e.g., COCO dataset).
preprocessing.py: Preprocesses the raw data for model training, such as resizing images, normalizing, and converting them to the correct format.
model.py: Contains the code for defining and training the U-Net model.
main.py: Tests the model on a custom image and visualizes the predicted segmentation.
U-Net Overview
U-Net is a convolutional neural network specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. Its encoder-decoder structure captures high-level features (encoder) and restores spatial dimensions (decoder). The use of skip connections transfers high-resolution features from the encoder to the decoder, improving segmentation accuracy.

U-Net is widely used for:

Medical image segmentation.
Object and region segmentation in various datasets.
Training the Model
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python model.py
Notes:

Ensure the raw data is preprocessed and available before training.
Training leverages TPU acceleration in Google Colab for faster processing.
Testing the Model
Once the model is trained, test it with new images:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
How to Use main.py:
Set the correct path to your trained model (model.h5).
Specify the path to the image you want to test.
The code will load the model, preprocess the input image, and display the segmentation result.
Example Code:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import cv2
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load trained model
model_path = 'path/to/model.h5'
model = load_model(model_path)

# Load and preprocess input image
img_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'
img = cv2.imread(img_path)
img = cv2.resize(img, (256, 256))
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
img = img.astype('float32') / 255.0
img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

# Predict and visualize
predictions = model.predict(img)
plt.imshow(predictions[0])  # Assuming output has the same shape as the input
plt.show()
Data
The dataset used for training is the COCO 2017 dataset, which contains a variety of labeled images. The data is preprocessed to focus on identifying specific regions (e.g., background and objects). The segmentation mask generated by the model is visualized by overlaying it on the original image.
